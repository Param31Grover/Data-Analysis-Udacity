# Data-Analysis-Udacity
In this Nanodegree Program we're using Python, SQL, and statistics to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.

### 1. Explore Weather Trends:
I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After cleaning the data, I've created a function, which was supposed to handle all the tasks that are needed to plot the data - for example calculating the linear trend and calculating the rolling average. In addition, the function had other various options for the visualization to get various graphs.

### 2. Investigate a Data set:
This project will examine datasets available at Gapminder. To be more specific, it will take a closer look on the life expectancy of the population from different countries and the influences from other variables. It will also take a look on the development of these variables over time.

### 3. Analyze AB test results:
The goal of the project in this chapter was to get experience with A/B testing, it's difficulties and drawbacks of it. First of all, we learned what A/B testing is all about - including different metrics like the Click Through Rate (CTR) and how to analyze these metrics properly. And second of all, we learned about the drawbacks like the novelty effect or change aversion. 

### 4. Wrangle and Analyze data:
In this project we had to deal with the reality of dirty and messy data (again). We gathered data from different sources (for example the Twitter API), identified issues with the dataset in terms of tidiness and quality. Afterwards we had to solve these problems while documenting each step. The end of the project was then focused on the exploration of the data.
